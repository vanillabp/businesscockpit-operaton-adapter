/**
 * Attaches the Business Cockpit's task listeners while the engine parses a user task of a
 * process the application claims.
 * <p>
  * The listeners are added as <b>built-in</b> ones, which keeps them out of reach of
  * <code>skipCustomListeners</code>. An operator who reassigns or deletes a task from the Operaton
  * web application asks the engine to skip the custom listeners of the model, and the cockpit
  * still has to learn that the task changed. A task list showing an assignee nobody can correct
  * is worse than no task list. It is also why all four events are taken rather than only the two
  * VanillaBP itself needs.
 * <p>
  * The listener carries the element id and the form key it was parsed with, so a runtime event
  * needs neither a model lookup nor a registry of its own. What the cockpit calls the task is the
  * Operaton adapter's own rule: the form key the modeller wrote, and the element id where the
  * model carries none. A task without a form is still a task somebody has to see.
 * <p>
  * A user task of any other process gets nothing. The engine parses every model it runs, also one
  * the workflow module deploys for somebody else and one somebody deployed past VanillaBP. The
  * cockpit reports nothing about those, so a listener there would only be one more thing in a
  * model which is not this application's. See decision 14 in the Camunda 7 extension's DECISIONS.md.
 * <p>
 * Why built-in and why after VanillaBP's own is decision 1 in the Camunda 7 extension's DECISIONS.md, and
 * that every user task gets them whether or not the application enriches it is decision 2 in the
 * Camunda 7 extension's DECISIONS.md.
