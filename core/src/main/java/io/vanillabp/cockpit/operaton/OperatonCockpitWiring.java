/**
 * The Operaton half of the Business Cockpit in VanillaBP's deployment pipeline.
 * <p>
  * It declares the Operaton adapter's model and processing-context types, so it takes part in
  * the deployment of a workflow module only where that module runs on Operaton. What it does
  * there is remember which BPMN processes a <code>&#64;WorkflowService</code> of the application
  * claims. That memory is what turns a process definition key an engine reports back into the
  * workflow module and the process id the application wrote, see
  * {@link OperatonWorkflowProcesses}.
 * <p>
  * A process the module deploys but no <code>&#64;WorkflowService</code> claims is not remembered.
  * It gets no listener and nothing about it is reported. The same holds for a process which
  * somebody deployed past VanillaBP, because the pipeline never hands that one over at all. See
  * decision 14 in the Camunda 7 extension's DECISIONS.md.
 * <p>
  * The model is not touched. On an embedded engine a listener is not written into the BPMN but
  * attached while the engine parses it, which is what the engine customizer of this extension
  * does. A model this extension rewrote would be a model the modeller no longer recognizes.
 * <p>
  * The order is the Business Cockpit's own, and {@link BusinessCockpitWiringService#ORDER} says
  * what that number means. What this class reads is a model the Operaton adapter has already
  * wired. That comes from the pipeline calling the adapter before any extension, not from the
  * number.
 * <p>
 * Why the processes are remembered rather than derived from an engine's identifiers later is
 * decision 4 in the Camunda 7 extension's DECISIONS.md.
