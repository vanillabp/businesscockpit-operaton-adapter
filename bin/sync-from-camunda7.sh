# Makes the code of this repository again from a commit of the Business Cockpit extension for
# Camunda 7, and commits the result to the branch 'generated'.
#
# The branch 'generated' holds nothing but what this script writes. 'main' merges it, so a
# Camunda 7 change reaches 'main' as an ordinary merge. Conflicts appear only where 'main' has
# its own fixes on top. CONTRIBUTING.md, section "Following the Camunda 7 extension", says what
# to do before and after the merge.
#
# What the script does, in this order:
#
#   1. It clones the Camunda 7 extension and checks out the given commit.
#   2. It copies that tree into a worktree of 'generated'. The files in KEPT_BY_MAIN stay out,
#      because 'main' writes its own. The recipe file and the script which lists the type
#      renames come from the checkout this script runs in, not from the Camunda 7 extension.
#   3. It runs Operaton's OpenRewrite recipe. That one renames what belongs to the engine:
#      packages, Maven coordinates, the getters of the model API.
#   4. It lists the type renames and runs VanillaBP's recipe rewrite/vanillabp-operaton.yml.
#      That one leaves the Operaton version to the Operaton adapter and renames what belongs
#      to VanillaBP: the adapter the extension plugs into, the Java package, the classes and
#      the names in strings.
#   5. It formats the result with the Spotless rules of the repository.
#   6. It commits the result as "generated from BC C7 <full sha>". It does not push.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/sync-from-camunda7.sh <camunda7 commit or tag>
#
# Environment:
#   C7_REPOSITORY   where the Camunda 7 extension is cloned from (default: its repository on
#                   GitHub)
#   MAVEN_ARGS      Maven reads this itself, in every call. For instance
#                   '-Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/m2' keeps the run out of your local repository.
#
# The recipes need the dependencies of the Camunda 7 extension, and one of them is the
# Camunda 7 adapter. Its snapshots are only in the GitHub Packages registry of the Camunda
# Community Hub, which wants a login even for reading. The script names that registry itself,
# so your Maven settings need only the server entry with the id
# 'camunda-community-hub-vanillabp-camunda7-adapter' and a token with 'read:packages'.
# CONTRIBUTING.md, section "Snapshots", shows the entry.
#
# The two recipes take a few minutes together. On an error the script stops and leaves
# its working directory behind, so the error can be read there. It prints where that is.
